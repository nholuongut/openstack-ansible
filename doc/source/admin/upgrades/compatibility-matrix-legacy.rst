Compatibility Matrix of Legacy releases
---------------------------------------

This page contains compatability matrix of releases that are either
in Extended Maintanence or already reached End of Life. We keep such matrix
for historical reasons mainly and for deployments that forgot to get updated
in time.

Operating systems with experimental support are marked with ``E`` in the table.
