deprecations:
  - |
    Key ``is_container_address`` that is used for definition of the
    `provider_networks` has been renamed to ``is_management_address``,
    to avoid confusion for bare metal deployments. Backwards compatability was
    kept.
  - |
    Variable ``container_address`` has been deprecated in favor of
    ``management_address``. Variable ``management_address`` is available since
    Victoria release and was defaulted to the value of ``container_address``.
