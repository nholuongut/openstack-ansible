upgrade:
  - |
    Services, that were makred as Inactive (Murano, Senlin, Sahara) will not be
    upgraded as they were not released for 2024.1 (Caracal).
    In order to keep managing these services on older versions you will need to
    do following actions:

    * Create file /etc/openstack_deploy/user-role-requirements.yml with following content:

      .. code-block:: yaml

        - name: os_<service>
          scm: git
          src: https://opendev.org/openstack/openstack-ansible-os_<service>
          version: master
          trackbranch: master

    * Playbooks for managing services can be found inside role examples, ie: ``/etc/ansible/roles/os_<service>/examples/playbook.yml``

    * Services will remain in your previously generated inventory until you explicitly remove them.

deprecations:

    Following roles are not going to be part of 2024.1 release due to services
    being trafered to `Inactive state <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/emerging-technology-and-inactive-projects.html#current-inactive-projects>`_:
    - Murano
    - Senlin
    - Sahara

    Playbooks for managing these services were also removed out of the tree
    and can be found only under specific role `examples` folder.
