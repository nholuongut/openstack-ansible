features:
  - |
    The configuration for serving port 80/443 in haproxy was previously
    associated with the Horizon service, but additional features such as
    handling certificate issuance with certbot and serving security.txt
    also need configuration in the same haproxy frontend. The existing
    variable ``haproxy_horizon_service`` now only describes the haproxy
    backend for horizon, and a new variable ``haproxy_base_service``
    configures the haproxy frontend for any services using port 80/443.
upgrades:
  - |
    Any existing overrides of ``haproxy_horizon_service`` should be
    adjusted to account for this variable now only describing the haproxy
    backend for horizon, and any overrides for LetsEncrypt, security.txt
    or other customisation of the haproxy frontend for port 80/443
    should be moved to ``haproxy_base_service`` or ``haproxy_base_service_overrides``.
