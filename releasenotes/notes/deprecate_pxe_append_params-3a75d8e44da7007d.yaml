deprecations:
  - |
    The `pxe_append_params` configuration option has been deprecated by
    Ironic and replaced with `kernel_append_params`. The corresponding
    configuration override, `ironic_pxe_append_params`, has been replaced
    by `ironic_kernel_append_params` but will continue to be supported
    until a future undetermined release.
