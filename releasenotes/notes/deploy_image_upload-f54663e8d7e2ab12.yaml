features:

    The os_ironic ansible role can now upload the ironic deploy image
    to glance. Several new variables are defined as ironic_deploy_image_*
    which control this. It is possible to disable the upload to glance and
    also to specify custom locations to stage the images from if required.
upgrade:
  - |
    The variables ironic_inspector_ipa_initrd_name and ironic_inspector_ipa_initrd_name
    are removed from the os_ironic role and more flexible functionality
    is now provided with the ironic_deplo_image_* variables. Review any
    overrides you have for the ironic service and adjust these new variables
    if necessary.
