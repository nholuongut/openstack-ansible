upgrade:
  - |
    Any deployments using the amqp1 oslo.messaging driver should be migrated
    to use the default rabbitmq oslo.messaging driver. Previously deprecated
    support for amqp1 has been removed from oslo.messaging for the Epoxy
    release, see https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/oslo.messaging/+/934116.
    Accordingly, support for amqp1 messaging and deployment of qdrouterd has
    been removed from OpenStack-Ansible. A migration away from amqp1 is required
    before any upgrade of OpenStack-Ansible to the Epoxy release. qdrouterd can
    be removed entirely from the deployment and ansible inventory once the migration
    to rabbitmq is complete.
deprecations:
  - |
    Use of amqp1 messaging, previously deprecated in oslo.messaging is not
    supported in the Epoxy release of OpenStack-Ansible. The previously
    supported provider of amqp1 messaging, qdrouterd, can no longer be deployed
    using the OpenStack-Ansible playbooks.
