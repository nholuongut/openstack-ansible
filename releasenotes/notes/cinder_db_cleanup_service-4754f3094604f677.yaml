    Added option to periodically clean-up deleted records from Cinder
    database.
    For this purpose a new service``cinder-purge-deleted`` was introduced.
    It will be called periodically using corresponsive systemd timer on the
    first cinder-api host.

    By default this service is disabled/stopped and database cleanup
    is not performed. You can enable this behaviour by defining variable
    ``cinder_purge_deleted``.
