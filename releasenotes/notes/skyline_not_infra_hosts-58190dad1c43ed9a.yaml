fixes:
  - |
    Skyline is not getting installed anymore by default as part of
    ``os-infra_hosts``, which might result in unwanted dashboard changes
    during OpenStack upgrade process.
other:
  - |
    Skyline was removed from being assigned to ``os-infra_hosts``. If you want
    to install Skyline as your dashboard, you need to define
    ``skyline_dashboard_hosts`` explicitly.
