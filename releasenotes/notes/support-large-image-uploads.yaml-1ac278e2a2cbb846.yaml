    A new override, `skyline_client_max_body_size`, has been introduced to
    support large image uploads via the Skyline dashboard. The default value
    of 1100M supports upstream Ubuntu and Rocky Linux images, but can be
    increased to support larger images or decreased to encourage the use
    of the CLI.
