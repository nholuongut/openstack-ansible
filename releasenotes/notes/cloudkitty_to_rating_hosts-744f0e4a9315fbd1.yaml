upgrade:
  - |
    Ensure that in openstack_user_config.yml / conf.d ``cloudkitty_hosts`` are
    replaced with ``rating_hosts``.
    For deployments with LXC containers: after upgrade is completed make sure
    that Cloudkitty is not running on your LXC hosts anymore, after which you
    should be able to remove LXC hosts from cloudkitty_all group in inventory.

fixes:
  - |
    Due to issue in env.d defenition for Cloudkitty, service was installed not
    only inside LXC containers, but also to all LXC hosts, which was not
    intended. This was fixed in env.d definition for the service, and it
    was renamed from ``cloudkitty_hosts`` to ``rating_hosts``, which should be
    reflected in your ``openstack_user_config.yml`` or conf.d files.
