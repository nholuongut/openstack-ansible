    Naming convention for containers has changed in Ansible inventory
    to match requirements defined by RFC1034.
    From now on, all newly added containers will not have underscore (``_``)
    symbol neither in their ``inventory_hostname`` nor in ``container_name``

    This change does not touch or alter already existing containers in the
    inventory.

    In order to apply new naming convention for an existing environment you
    need to delete containers on the host and from the inventory. After that
    new container name will be generated and container can be created again.
