    Added option to periodically clean-up deleted records from Nova
    database. Having a lot of records for the deleted instances affects
    service performance.
    With that 2 new services are being introduced: ``nova-archive-deleted``
    and ``nova-purge-deleted`` that will be called periodically using
    corresponsive systemd timers on the first nova-conductor host.

    By default these services are disabled/stopped and database cleanup
    is not performed. You can enable this behaviour by defining variables
    ``nova_archive_deleted`` and ``nova_purge_deleted``.

    Service ``nova-archive-deleted`` will execute
    `nova-manage db archive_deleted_rows` while ``nova-archive-deleted``
    will execute `nova-manage db purge`. Please correspond to nova-manage
    documentation for more information on what these commands do:
