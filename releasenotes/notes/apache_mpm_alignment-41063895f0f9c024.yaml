features:
  - |
    Added variable ``openstack_apache_mpm_backend`` which is used as a default
    value by service-specific variables to define used Apache MPM across the
    deployment. Defaults MPM ``event`` will be used if not overriden.
fixes:
  - |
    Used Apache MPMs are aligned across services and will not conflict with
    each other on `metal` deployments. Apache MPM `event` is being used by
    default.
