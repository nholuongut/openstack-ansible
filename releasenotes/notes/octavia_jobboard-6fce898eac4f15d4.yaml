    With adding zookeeper as coordination backend Octavia will be configured
    to use amphorav2 as default provider driver. This will result in creating
    a new database and jobboard configuration. You can control database name
    with variable ``octavia_galera_persistence_database`` and existing octavia
    db user will be granted ALL permissions to that database.
