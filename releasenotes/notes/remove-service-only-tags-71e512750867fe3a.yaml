    Tags matching service names have been removed from os-<service>-install.yml
    playbooks. For example 'nova', 'neutron', 'cinder' etc. These tags were
    only useful in conjunction with setup-openstack.yml, but were found to have
    unexpected behaviour, potentially causing important tasks to be skipped.
