    Horizon now has the ability to run directly from uWSGI. To support
    this feature the new Boolean variable `horizon_use_uwsgi` has
    been added. The new variable, when set to **true**, will omit the
    apache2 install process and instead run horizon from a uWSGI process
    leveraging a systemd service file.

    When the option `horizon_use_uwsgi` is enabled, operators need
    to be aware that not all horizon capabilities will be present. The
    minimal uSGI process is just that, minimal, and not full featured.
    If the deployment requires full featured capabilities, the apache
    based deployment should remain enabled.
