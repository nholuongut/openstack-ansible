    As of today ceph community repository (download.ceph.com) does not provide
    packages for Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy). Based on that OpenStack-Ansible does
    install ceph packages from distro-provided repositories. Thus, you can not
    control packages version that will be installed and ceph support should be
    considered as experimental.
