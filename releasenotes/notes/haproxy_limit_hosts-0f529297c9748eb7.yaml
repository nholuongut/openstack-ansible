features:
  - |
    A mapping ``<service>_haproxy_services`` now can contain a key
    ``haproxy_limit_hosts``, which can be used to filter out haproxy
    nodes to which this config should be applied.
    This behaviour might be useful in case you want to apply a different
    service configuration to haproxy hosts.
fixes:
  - |
    Functionality of providing different haproxy service settings per haproxy
    host has been restored through ``haproxy_limit_hosts`` key which provides
    filtering of target HAProxy hosts, to which this configuration should be
    applied.
    Before moving ``<service>_haproxy_services`` from `haproxy_all` group_vars
    it was possible to supply a completely independent set of backends
    that will be configured on the HAProxy server.
    With moving backend defenition to specific service group_vars, this ability
    was lost, as there was no way to tell what config to apply to which HAProxy
    server.
