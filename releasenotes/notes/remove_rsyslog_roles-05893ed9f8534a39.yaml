deprecations:
  - |
    Roles ``rsyslog_client`` and ``rsyslog_server`` are deprecated and removed
    from OpenStack-Ansible. Since Train service were configured to save logs
    in journald instead of regular log files. Journald from containers passed
    to hosts, so you can read and manipulate logs from metal hosts. Journald
    can be transformed and collected by many tools, including rsyslog.
    At the same time rsyslog is not ideal as it stores data in plain text,
    which is hard to index and search later, while journald has is
    structured so logs can be consumed way more efficiently with other tools.
    You can also check out our ELK role from `OPS repository <https://opendev.org/openstack/openstack-ansible-ops/src/branch/master/elk_metrics_7x>`_
    as alternative.
