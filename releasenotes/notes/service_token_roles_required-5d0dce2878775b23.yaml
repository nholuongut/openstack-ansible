    Since Yoga release ``service`` role is being assigned to all service users.
    Though, service_token_roles_required was set to ``False`` for upgrade
    purposes. Now ``service_token_roles_required`` is set to ``True`` by
    default. If you still want to preserve old behaviour, you can define
    ``openstack_service_token_roles_required: False`` in your user_variables.
