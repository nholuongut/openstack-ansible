    The lxc_hosts role now supports the ability to omit lxc network
    interface deployment. The option `lxc_net_managed` is a Boolean
    operator and defaults to **true**. When this option is set to
    **false** the role will not deploy an interface file or attempt
    to manage the state of the interface.
