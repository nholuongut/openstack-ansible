    A new parameter `octavia_provider_network_mtu` is added to set the
    MTU to 1500 by default. This is important for deployments which
    allow jumbo frames while setting the management to the standard
    Ethernet MTU. The MTU can be still changed at any point during the
    initial octavia deployment or with the
    `openstack network set --mtu` command line.
