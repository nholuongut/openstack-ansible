    The external dependancy ceph-ansible is upgraded to version 8.0 and
    brings in significant changes within the ceph-ansible project. Deployers
    using OpenStack-Ansible are reminded that the ceph-ansible integration
    with OSA is primarily a test fixture and production deployments should
    ideally deploy an independant ceph cluster. The upgrade between releases
    of ceph-ansible is not tested by the OpenStack-Ansible project.

    Any deployments with important data held in a ceph cluster deployed
    using the OpenStack-Ansible integration with ceph-ansible should
    independantly verify that upstream changes in ceph-ansible result
    in a successful upgrade. This could undertaken in a test or staging
    environment. The upgrade between releases of ceph-ansible is not
    tested by the OpenStack-Ansible project.
