features:
  - |
    A new parameter, `octavia_ovn_enabled`, is added to support the
    Octavia OVN provider driver. The Octavia OVN provider driver
    is an alternative to amphora and uses built-in support for
    load balancing withing OVN/OVS. The `ml2.ovn` Neutron plugin
    is required for this functionality. The OVN provider can be used
    during load balancer creation by specifying the `--provider ovn`
    argument for the `openstack loadbalancer create` command.
  - |
    Added new variable ``octavia_enabled_provider_agents`` that allows
    to enable Provider Agents for Octavia.
