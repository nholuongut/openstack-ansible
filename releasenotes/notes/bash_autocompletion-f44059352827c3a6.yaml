    Added a bash auto-completion script which will assist with running
    openstack-ansible commands. It is placed as
    ``/etc/bash_completion.d/openstack-ansible``, so please make sure
    your .bashrc is configured to load completion scripts from there.
    As of today it can help with completing playbook names, which are part
    of collections, Ansible native flags and hosts in case of ``--limit``
    flag is used.
