    A new key ``haproxy_default_backend`` can be defined for each service
    configured in the haproxy loadbalancer. Configuring this variable writes
    a value for the ``default_backend`` directive into the config for the
    service frontend. It can be useful to provide a specific default backend
    as a fall-through option when other backends are selected using ACLs,
    and to also allow the name of the default backend to be different from
    ``haproxy_service_name``.
