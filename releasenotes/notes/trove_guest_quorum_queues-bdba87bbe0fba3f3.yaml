    Trove role introduced variables to independently configure RPC/Notification
    communication for Guest Agent:
    - trove_guest_oslomsg_rabbit_quorum_queues
    - trove_guest_oslomsg_rpc_port
    - trove_guest_oslomsg_rpc_userid
    - trove_guest_oslomsg_rpc_password
    - trove_guest_oslomsg_rpc_vhost
upgrade:
  - |
    It is highly recommended to explicitly disable
    ``trove_guest_oslomsg_rabbit_quorum_queues`` during upgrade in case
    ``oslomsg_rabbit_quorum_queues: True``, which is default behaviour
    since 2024.1 (Caracal).
    Migration to Quorum queues for Trove Guestagent is not supported and
    might be troublesome, as already spawned agents will not reload
    configuration.
    New deployments though may utilize quorum queues from the very
    beginning safely.
