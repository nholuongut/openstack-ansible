    Added new ``management_ip`` option, that can be defined in conf.d or
    openstack_user_config.yml files for hosts. It might be useful if SSH
    network for accessing hosts differs from OpenStack management network.
    Option ``management_ip`` should be set to an IP address that represents
    management network on the host, while ``ip`` option remains to represent
    SSH address that will be used to access host by Ansible.
