features:
  - |
    Automatic generation of ``ansible_<variable>`` fact vars is now disabled
    when using the ``openstack-ansible`` command. There is now less data to
    pass to the target hosts when executing ansible modules. The same values
    are now accessed as follows: ``ansible_facts['variable']``
upgrade:
  - |
    Any external or 3rd party integrations with openstack-ansible that use
    the ``openstack-ansible`` command line wrapper around ``ansible-playbook``
    and access ansible facts via the ``ansible_<variable>`` pattern must be
    refactored to access those variables as follows: ``ansible_facts['variable']``.
    If this is not possible, the environment variable ``ANSIBLE_INJECT_FACT_VARS``
    can be set to ``True`` to restore the previous behaviour.
