features:
  - |
    The apt repository setup for the rabbitmq_server role is migrated to use
    the deb822_repository ansible module rather than the legacy apt_key and
    apt_repository modules. The format of the `rabbitmq_repo` and
    `rabbitmq_erlang_repo` ole default variables are changed to match the
    requirements of the new module, and are now lists allowing multiple
    repositories to be configured if required.
upgrade:
  - |
    The configuration of apt repositories for the rabbitmq_server role through
    the `rabbitmq_repo` variable is changed to match the deb822_repository
    ansible module. Any deployments that customise the repository
    configuration should adjust their `rabbitmq_repo` and `rabbitmq_erlang_repo`
    overrides to suit.
