    Default values for variables ``octavia_loadbalancer_topology`` and
    ``octavia_enable_anti_affinity`` has been switched to ``ACTIVE_STANDBY``
    and ``True`` accordingly to reflect most reasonable production setup.
    You can define these variables to their previous defaults if you want
    to preserve behaviour.
