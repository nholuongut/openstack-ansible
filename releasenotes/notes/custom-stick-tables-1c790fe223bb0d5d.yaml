features:
  - |
    A new variable ``haproxy_stick_table`` can be defined to apply a
    customised stick-table to all backends on the loadbalancer. In addition,
    ``haproxy_stick_table`` can be set in each service definition to have a
    customised stick-table for a particular backend.
upgrade:
  - |
    A default stick-table was previously applied to all backends by default
    but did not have any specific purpose. This is now removed, and the variable
    ``haproxy_stick_table`` should be used to supply a list of config lines
    to be applied to each backend to control stick-table functionality.
