  Default neutron plugin has been switched from LinuxBridge to OVN.
  This is effective for all new deployments. At the same time
  OpenStack-Ansible does not provide any in-house tooling for completing
  upgrade from ml2.lxb to ml2.ovn. Please, reffer to upgrade section for more
  details on how to upgrade OpenStack-Ansible.

    With marking ML2/LinuxBridge driver as 'Experimental' in the upstream
    Neutron project OpenStack-Ansible has switched a default mechanism driver
    to ML2/OVN.
    In order to upgrade any existing deployment that was relying on defaults
    to the new OpenStack-Ansible version you must ensure that following
    variables are defined explicitly to ensure parity with existing
    functionality:

    .. code-block:: yaml

      neutron_plugin_type: ml2.lxb
      neutron_ml2_drivers_type: "flat,vlan,vxlan,local"
      neutron_plugin_base:
        - router
        - metering

    Failure to define any of these variables will result in playbook failures
    and neutron misconfiguration.

    We have covered this step with upgrade script that will create a
    ``user_neutron_migration.yml`` file with assumed defaults.
