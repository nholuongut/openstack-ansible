features:
  - |
    Added ``zookepeer`` role which deploys zookeeper cluster that can be used
    as a coordination driver for services like cinder, designate, octavia, etc.
    For deployment you need to specify ``coordination_hosts`` in your conf.d
    or openstack_user_config.yml and run ``zookeeper-install.yml`` playbook.
  - |
    Added following variables that are designed to control coordination
    configuration. Reasonable defaults are set for services to work out of
    the box.

    * coordination_driver
    * coordination_group
    * coordination_client_ssl
    * coordination_verify_cert
    * coordination_port

    Also each service that uses coordination have following variables defined:

    * <service>_coordination_enable
    * <service>_coordination_url

upgrade:
  - |
    If you are using cinder in active/active mode (ie with Ceph backend), it's
    highly recommended to define ``coordination_hosts`` before upgrade to
    deploy zookeeper coordination cluster which is required for proper work
    of cinder active/active mode.
