    When using RabbitMQ in a high availability cluster (non-quorum queues),
    transient 'reply\_' queues are now included in the HA policy where they
    previously were not. Note that this will increase the load on the RabbitMQ
    cluster, particularly for deployments with large numbers of compute nodes.
