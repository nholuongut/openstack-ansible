features:
  - Add parameters ``galera_mariadb_backups_full_randomized_delay_sec`` and
    ``galera_mariadb_backups_incremental_randomized_delay_sec`` to run the
    systemd timers for mariabackup with a randomized delay. This is useful if
    backups are done of more than one node to avoid running it at the exact
    same time.
