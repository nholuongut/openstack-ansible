  Added support to deploy Skyline dashboard.

features:
  - |
    OpenStack-Ansible can now be used to deploy Skyline, an alternantive
    dashboard. New example files have been added to `env.d` and `conf.d`
    to support the Skyline infrastructure, and a playbook named
    `os-skyline-install.yml` has been added to deploy the API and console
    service.
other:
  - |
    When Skyline is deployed with the built-in HAProxy server it will, by
    default, listen on port 80 when ssl is disabled and port 443 when ssl
    is enabled. Skyline backend in it's term will listen on port 9999.

    When Skyline is attempted to be deployed with Horizon, Skyline will
    take precedence by serving on port 80/443. In the meanwhile Horizon
    will be available in "subdirectory" ``/horizon``.
