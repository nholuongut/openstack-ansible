upgrade:
  - |
    Please be aware that the way Ceilometer defines resulting content for ``pipeline.yaml`` has changed.
    The role now applies `_ceilometer_pipeline_yaml_overrides <https://opendev.org/openstack/openstack-ansible-os_ceilometer/src/commit/c97b49a22098b57520dceef9f236c7378dddfce1/vars/main.yml#L59-L150>`_
    to all environments where ``ceilometer_pipeline_user_content`` is not explicitly set.
    To restore the previous behavior, add ``_ceilometer_pipeline_yaml_overrides: {}`` to user_variables.yml.
fixes:
  - |
    The logic for applying enhanced pipelines for Ceilometer+Gnocchi has been corrected.
    When no custom content is provided, the role now populates
    sinks and transformation overrides defined in pipeline.yaml with default content,
    rather than layering them on top of user-defined content.
