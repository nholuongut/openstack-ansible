    A new key `haproxy_map_entries` is now able to be configured for each
    haproxy service definition to allow arbitrary entries to be placed in
    any number of haproxy map files which may then be referenced in other
    directives in the haproxy config file such as ``use_backend`` or
    ``http-request``. The complete map files are constructed from the
    fragments defined across all the service definitions and are assembled
    into a complete map file in alphanumeric sort order, or optionally with
    a user defined ordering.
